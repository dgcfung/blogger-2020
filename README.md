## Overview

Blogger-2020 will be a re-designed modern version of the "Blogger" app. The Blogger-2020 app will include a build out back-end using Rails and allow Full CRUD functionality in adding users. The app will feature 1:m association between users & posts and 1:m association between posts & comments. Users will be able to make blog posts which post to their personal endpoint.

### Permissions

N/A, all rights will be reserved to General Assembly and Donald Fung. Will add additional permissions as project progresses if applicable.

## MVP


Blogger 2020's Minimum Viable Product will feature a Full-stack application featuring a back-end built on Rails and front-end built on react. The app will feature User Authentication login with full CRUD controller capabilities for users. 

## Backend MVP
The main feature of the backend will be User Authentication. The built out server will use RESTful JSON endpoints with self-created data. The database will include one user table and two additional tables of posts and comments. Users & posts will have a 1:m relationship and posts and comments will have 1:m relationship.

## Frontend MVP

The frontend will have 8 components of Login, createUser, Profile, Posts, Contact Blogger, About Blogger, Header, and Footer. It take data the Rails backend and parse them onto the page. It will also use React Router to route. Frontend will indicate index or show actions to indicate when a user is logged in or not.
 
The front end will also allow for full CRUD capabilities to create, update, and delete posts. CSS styling will be included for a responsive page to suit mobile and desktop.




> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

## Planning

> You've got a little over a week to reach your Minimum Viable Product. Use these sections to plan out your approach.

<br>

### Timeframes

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out the various sections of your project. You may include an additional priority matrix, if you desire.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

<br>

### Schedule

> Use this section to look at your project week and plan out when and what you want to do.
